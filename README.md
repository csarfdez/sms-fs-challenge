## Technologies used

The following demo application uses Angular 13 with SASS on the front-end layer, NodeJS and Express on the back-end layer and a PostgreSQL database.
Additionally, the application is also Dockerized in a Docker container for easy run and deployment.

## How to run

Just run "docker-compose up --build -d" in the main directory (just check that the directory contains docker-compose file) and 
wait about a minute for the container to start.

When all the services are up, go to the navigator and enter the following URL: "localhost:4200" and access to the application.
